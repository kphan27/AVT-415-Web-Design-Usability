      <h2>Fungi Insights</h2>
        <p>Fungi play an important role in energy cycling within, and between, ecosystems. Fungi are found in terrestrial, marine and freshwater environments, and are part of a diverse community of “decomposers” that break down dead plants and animals. Aside from fungi, this community includes bacteria, tiny invertebrates, such as nematodes, and larger invertebrates, like snails, beetles and earthworms. Fungi, along with bacteria, are great recyclers, and will return much of the dead material like leaves and dead animals found in forests to soil. Without them we would be buried in meters of dead materials.</p>

      <h2>Decomposition</h2>
        <p>Fungi play a very important part in the decomposition process, because they can break down tough organic materials, such as cellulose and lignin, which invertebrates find difficult to digest. Fungi release digestive enzymes that are used to metabolize complex organic compounds into soluble nutrients, such as simple sugars, nitrates and phosphates. Unlike animals, that digest food inside their bodies, fungi digest food outside of their “bodies” and then absorb the nutrients into their cells.</p>

      <h2>Mushrooms in Nature</h2>
        <p>The length of life, the way of feeding and reproduction determine their value. They are involved in almost all life processes, entering into symbiosis with plants and animals. The economic value of mushrooms is that they are eaten, they are made into medicines, used in cooking, etc. Furthermore, the importance of mushrooms in nature is determined by the fact that they affect the circulation of substances, plant life, and the life of animals.</p>
